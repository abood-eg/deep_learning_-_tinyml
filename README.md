# CNN model for sign language recognition

## The Idea 
This project aims to use machine learning on a microcontroller to transolate hand gesture into a speech message that normal people can understand.

- Requirements

      pip install tensorflow, sklearn, numpy, matplotlib,tensorflow-model-optimization 

## ToDo

* [x]  navigate your os files to get the data from files
* [x] store the data in a 3d numpy array 
* [x] reshape the data to suit the convolution layer
* [x] graph the data using the matplotlib liberary
* [x] set the right parameter to the neural network to get a good model
* [x] make a test data to test the model
* [x] refactor the code *DRY*
* [x] set the pre_aware quantization so that the model knows it is to be quantized
* [ ] convert the model to tensorflow lite micro 
* [ ] deploy it on a micro controller *esp32*
